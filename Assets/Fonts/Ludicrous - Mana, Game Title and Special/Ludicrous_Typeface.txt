UPDATE: December 2016. I've done some gentle rearranging of glyphs, and added in a ton more accented characters. Plus, now Ludicrous is available in both OTF and TTF formats. Plus, hey, some new promo images!

It's time for another free font!

With every font, I learn something new. This time around, I did my first ligatures. I've included the 15 lowercase letter pairs I thought were most common. (I skipped over "uu," because I don't know about you, but I don't type "vacuum" all that often.) (Note: I hadn't included "cc" originally. But the more I thought about it, the more words I thought of with that double-c in them. So I added "cc" to the mix.)

This was also my first attempt at creating the letters in Photoshop, instead of in Illustrator. Still not sure which one I like better; more testing is required.

I've also added in a few little extras in the Private Use Area.

As always, this font is free for personal and commercial use (see included license for limitations). I'd love to see what you do with it -- drop me a line!



Not sure how to access the alternate characters (ligatures, accented characters, dingbats, etc.) in a font?
* Adobe Photoshop: Window ^ Glyphs
* Adobe Illustrator: Window ^ Type ^ Glyphs
* Adobe InDesign: Window ^ Type & Tables ^ Glyphs
* Windows: Program "Character Map" (Start Menu ^ type in "charmap")
* Mac: Program "Font Book"
